No Javascript inline
    Javascript stops the load of the page until the JS file is evaluated and
    executed if needed.
    Ex. document.write/document.writeln...
CSS Before Javascript files in HEAD
Put your javascript in external files.
Javascript files must be added before close the body element to improve the
render time sensation for the user.
Use document ready instead of window.onload.
Don't create HTML in JS ->  Use templates systems.
Don't change CSS in JS  ->  Change class instead
